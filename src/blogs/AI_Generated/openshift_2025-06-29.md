# OpenShift: An Introduction

OpenShift is a containerization platform that enables developers to build, deploy, and manage containerized applications in a scalable and efficient manner. In this blog post, we will explore the key features and capabilities of OpenShift, and provide code examples to illustrate how to use some of its most commonly used tools and features.
## Architecture

OpenShift is built on top of Kubernetes, a widely-used container orchestration platform. Kubernetes provides a highly-available, highly-scalable infrastructure for managing containers, while OpenShift adds additional features and capabilities to make it easier for developers to work with containers.

## Features


OpenShift provides a range of features that make it an attractive choice for developers and organizations looking to build and deploy containerized applications. Some of the key features include:

### Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment

OpenShift provides a built-in continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD) pipeline, which enables developers to automate their development workflows and deploy applications to production in a consistent and efficient manner.

### ImageStreams

ImageStreams are a key feature of OpenShift, which allows developers to create and manage images of their applications. ImageStreams enable developers to create a stream of images that can be used to deploy applications, and provides a way to manage the lifecycle of those images.

### Builds

OpenShift provides a build system that enables developers to create and manage builds of their applications. Builds can be used to create a final application image, or to create a set of intermediate images that can be used to deploy the application.

### Deployments

OpenShift provides a deployment system that enables developers to deploy their applications to production. Deployments can be used to create a set of replicas of an application, which can be used to scale the application up or down as needed.

### Services

OpenShift provides a service system that enables developers to create and manage services for their applications. Services can be used to expose an application to external users, or to provide a set of endpoints that can be used to interact with the application.

### Secrets and ConfigMaps

OpenShift provides a secret and config map system that enables developers to manage sensitive data, such as passwords and configuration settings, in a secure manner.

## Code Examples


To illustrate how to use some of the key features and capabilities of OpenShift, let's provide some code examples.

### Building and Deploying an Application

To build and deploy an application using OpenShift, we can use the following code:
```
# Create a new ImageStream
oc create-image-stream -n my-app <image-stream-name>
# Build a new image using the ImageStream
oc build -t <image-name> -n my-app .
# Deploy the image to the cluster
oc deploy -n my-app <image-name>
```
This code creates a new ImageStream, builds a new image using the ImageStream, and deploys the image to the cluster.

### Creating a Deployment

To create a deployment using OpenShift, we can use the following code:
```
# Create a new deployment
oc create deployment <deployment-name> -n my-app

# Create a new service
oc create service <service-name> -n my-app -t <service-type>

# Update the deployment with the new service
oc update deployment <deployment-name> -n my-app -s <service-name>
```
This code creates a new deployment, creates a new service, and updates the deployment with the new service.

### Creating a Service

To create a service using OpenShift, we can use the following code:
```
# Create a new service
oc create service <service-name> -n my-app -t <service-type>
```
This code creates a new service with the specified name and type.

### Secrets and ConfigMaps

To manage secrets and config maps using OpenShift, we can use the following code:
```
# Create a new secret
oc create secret <secret-name> -n my-app -d <data>

# Get the secret
oc get secret <secret-name> -n my-app

# Update the secret
oc update secret <secret-name> -n my-app -d <new-data>

# Create a new config map
oc create configmap <configmap-name> -n my-app -d <data>

# Get the config map
oc get configmap <configmap-name> -n my-app

# Update the config map
oc update configmap <configmap-name> -n my-app -d <new-data>
```
This code creates a new secret and config map, gets the contents of the secret and config map, updates the contents of the secret and config map, and creates a new config map.

Conclusion
In this blog post, we have explored the key features and capabilities of OpenShift, and provided code examples to illustrate how to use some of its most commonly used tools and features. OpenShift is a powerful containerization platform that enables developers to build, deploy, and manage containerized applications in a scalable and efficient manner. Its features, such as continuous integration and continuous deployment, image streams, builds, deployments, services, secrets, and config maps, make it an attractive choice for developers and organizations looking to build and deploy containerized applications.
