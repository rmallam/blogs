 Write a technical blog post about Transformer Networks. Include code examples where relevant. Format in markdown.
Transformer Networks are a class of neural network architecture that have gained popularity in recent years due to their effectiveness in processing sequential data. They were introduced in a paper by Vaswani et al. in 2017 and have since been widely adopted in natural language processing tasks such as machine translation and language modeling. In this blog post, we will provide an overview of Transformer Networks, their architecture, and how they can be used in Python using the Keras library.
Overview of Transformer Networks
Transformer Networks are a type of encoder-decoder network that are particularly well-suited for sequential data. They are composed of an encoder and a decoder, each of which is composed of multiple identical layers. Each layer in the encoder and decoder consists of a self-attention mechanism followed by a feed-forward neural network (FFNN). The self-attention mechanism allows the network to weigh the importance of different input elements relative to each other, allowing it to capture long-range dependencies in the input sequence. The FFNN processes the output of the self-attention mechanism to produce the final output of the layer.
 Architecture of Transformer Networks
The architecture of a Transformer Network is shown below:
