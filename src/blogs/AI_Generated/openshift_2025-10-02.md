Introduction
============

OpenShift is a powerful platform for deploying and managing containerized applications in a Kubernetes environment. In this post, we'll take a closer look at how to use OpenShift to deploy and manage a simple web application.
Prerequisites
-------------

Before we begin, you'll need to have the following installed on your system:

* OpenShift CLI installed
* Docker installed
* Kubernetes installed

Deploying the Application
=======================

To deploy our simple web application, we'll use the OpenShift CLI to create a new deployment. Here's an example of the command to create a new deployment:
```
oc create deployment web-app --image=node:latest
```
This command will create a new deployment called "web-app" using the "node:latest" image.
Verifying the Deployment
=====================

Once the deployment has been created, we can use the `oc get deployment` command to verify that it was created successfully:
```
oc get deployment
```
This command will show us the details of the deployment, including the image used and the status of the deployment.
Scaling the Deployment
=====================

To scale our deployment, we can use the `oc scale` command. For example, to scale the deployment up to 3 replicas, we can use the following command:
```
oc scale deployment/web-app --replicas=3
```
This command will increase the number of replicas of the deployment to 3.
Accessing the Application
=====================

Once our deployment is running, we can access our web application by navigating to the URL of the deployment. For example, if our deployment is running on the host "my-host", we can access our web application by navigating to `http://my-host:8080`.
Updating the Application
=====================

As our application changes, we may need to update the image used in our deployment. To do this, we can use the `oc update` command. For example, to update the image to "node:latest", we can use the following command:
```
oc update deployment/web-app --image=node:latest
```
This command will update the image used in our deployment to the latest version of "node".
Conclusion
==============

In this post, we've covered the basics of deploying and managing a simple web application on OpenShift. We've seen how to create a new deployment, verify its status, scale it up, and access it. With these basic commands, you should be able to deploy and manage your own containerized applications on OpenShift.
Remember, this is just a simple example of how to deploy a web application on OpenShift. In a real-world scenario, you may need to perform additional configuration and management tasks to ensure your application is running smoothly. [end of text]
