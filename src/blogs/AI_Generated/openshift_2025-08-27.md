# Introduction

OpenShift is a container platform built on top of Kubernetes that provides a managed environment for deploying and managing containerized applications. In this blog post, we will explore the key features of OpenShift, and show how to deploy a simple web application using the platform.
# Key Features of OpenShift

1. **Containers and Images**: OpenShift supports a wide range of container images, including Docker, rkt, and others. You can easily create and manage containers using these images, and deploy them to a cluster.
2. **Deployments**: OpenShift provides a simple way to deploy applications to a cluster. You can define a deployment configuration, which defines the number of replicas, image, and other settings, and OpenShift will automatically create and manage the deployment.
3. **Services**: OpenShift provides a service discovery mechanism that allows you to easily access your applications. You can define a service, which defines the IP address and port that the service will expose, and OpenShift will automatically create a load balancer that routes traffic to the service.
4. **Persistent Volumes**: OpenShift supports persistent volumes, which allow you to persist data even if the container is deleted or recreated. This is particularly useful for stateful applications.
5. **Rollouts and Rollbacks**: OpenShift provides a rollout and rollback mechanism that allows you to safely update your application. You can define a rollout strategy, which defines how the application will be updated, and OpenShift will automatically apply the changes.
# Deploying a Simple Web Application

To deploy a simple web application using OpenShift, follow these steps:
1. **Create a new project**: Create a new project in OpenShift by running the command `oc new-project my-project`.
2. **Create a Dockerfile**: Create a Dockerfile that defines the base image and copies the web application code into the image. For example:
```
FROM node:alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
RUN npm run build
EXPOSE 80
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```
3. **Build the Docker image**: Build the Docker image using the command `oc build -t my-web-app .`.
4. **Push the image to OpenShift**: Push the Docker image to OpenShift using the command `oc push my-web-app`.
5. **Create a deployment**: Create a deployment configuration that defines the image and other settings for the application. For example:
```
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-web-app

spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-web-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-web-app
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: my-web-app
          image: my-web-app
          ports:
            - containerPort: 80
```
6. **Create a service**: Create a service that defines the IP address and port that the service will expose. For example:

apiVersion: v1
kind: Service

metadata:
  name: my-web-app

spec:
  type: LoadBalancer
  selector:
    app: my-web-app
  ports:
    - name: http
          port: 80
          targetPort: 80
```
7. **Deploy the application**: Deploy the application using the command `oc rollout undo`. This will create the deployment and service.
8. **Access the application**: Use the command `oc exec my-web-app -- curl http://my-web-app.default.svc.cluster.local/` to access the application.
This is just a simple example of how to deploy a web application using OpenShift. In a real-world scenario, you would likely need to define more complex deployment configurations and services, and manage additional aspects of your application, such as persistence and security. However, this example should give you a good starting point for understanding how to use OpenShift to deploy containerized applications. [end of text]
