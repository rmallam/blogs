# Deep Learning: A Technical Overview

Deep learning (DL) is a subset of machine learning (ML) that involves the use of artificial neural networks to analyze and interpret data. DL has been instrumental in achieving state-of-the-art performance in a wide range of applications, including image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and autonomous driving. In this blog post, we will provide an overview of DL, its history, key concepts, and code examples.
## History of Deep Learning

DL has its roots in the 1950s and 60s, when researchers like Marvin Minsky and Seymour Papert proposed the idea of artificial neural networks (ANNs) as a means of simulating the human brain. However, early ANNs were limited by the lack of computational power and the difficulty of training large networks. In the 1980s and 90s, advances in computing power and the development of new training algorithms led to a resurgence of interest in DL. The term "deep learning" was coined in 1998 by Yann LeCun, and since then, DL has become a rapidly growing field with numerous applications in computer vision, speech recognition, and natural language processing.
## Key Concepts in Deep Learning

1. **Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs):** ANNs are the building blocks of DL. ANNs are composed of interconnected nodes (neurons) that process inputs and produce outputs. Each neuron receives a set of inputs, performs a computation on those inputs, and passes the output to other neurons.
| **Input** | **Compute** | **Output** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Node 1** | **Weight** | **Node 2** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Input** | **Weight** | **Output** |

2. **Layers:** ANNs are organized into layers, each of which performs a different computation on the inputs. The most common types of layers are:
* **Flatten**: Flattens a 3D tensor (e.g., an image) into a 1D tensor.
| **Input** | **Output** |

| --- | --- |

| **Flatten** | **Input** | **Output** |

* **Convolutional**: Applies a filter to a 2D tensor (e.g., an image) to detect patterns.
| **Input** | **Weight** | **Output** |

| --- | --- | --- |

| **Convolutional** | **Input** | **Weight** | **Output** |

* **Pooling**: Reduces the spatial dimensions of a 2D tensor (e.g., an image) to reduce its size.
| **Input** | **Output** |

| --- | --- | --- |

| **Pooling** | **Input** | **Output** |

3. **Activation Functions:** ANNs use activation functions to introduce non-linearity into the computation. Common activation functions include:
* **Sigmoid**: Maps the input to a value between 0 and 1.
| **Input** | **Output** |

| --- | --- | --- |

| **Sigmoid** | **Input** | **Output** |

* **ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit)**: Maps negative inputs to 0 and positive inputs to the same value.
| **Input** | **Output** |

| --- | --- | --- |

| **ReLU** | **Input** | **Output** |

* **Tanh**: Maps the input to a value between -1 and 1.
| **Input** | **Output** | **Output** |

| --- | --- | --- | --- |

| **Tanh** | **Input** | **Output** | **Output** |

4. **Optimization Algorithms:** DL algorithms use optimization algorithms to minimize the loss between the predicted output and the actual output. Common optimization algorithms include:
* **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)**: Gradually adjusts the weights of the ANN to minimize the loss.
| **Loss** | **Gradient** | **Weights** |



| --- | --- | --- |



| **SGD** | **Loss** | **Gradient** | **Weights** |


* **Adam**: An optimization algorithm that adapts the learning rate based on the magnitude of the gradient.
| **Loss** | **Gradient** | **Weights** | **Learning Rate** |



| --- | --- | --- | --- |



| **Adam** | **Loss** | **Gradient** | **Weights** | **Learning Rate** |


## Code Examples

To illustrate the key concepts of DL, we will provide code examples in Python using the Keras library. Keras is a high-level API that provides an easy-to-use interface for building and training ANNs.
1. **Flatten**:
```
import keras
# Define a 3D tensor (e.g., an image)
input = keras.Input(shape=(32, 32, 3))
# Flatten the tensor into a 1D tensor
output = keras.layers.Flatten(input)(input)
print(output.shape)
```
The output of the `Flatten` layer will be a 1D tensor with the same shape as the input tensor.
2. **Convolutional**:
```
import keras
# Define a 2D tensor (e.g., an image)
input = keras.Input(shape=(32, 32, 3))
# Apply a filter to the tensor
filter = keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu')
output = keras.layers.Conv2D(filter, input)
print(output.shape)
```
The output of the `Conv2D` layer will be a 2D tensor with the same shape as the input tensor, but with the filter applied to each location.
3. **Pooling**:
```
import keras

# Define a 2D tensor (e.g., an image)

input = keras.Input(shape=(32, 32, 3))

# Apply a pooling operation to the tensor

pooling = keras.layers.MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2))(input)
print(pooling.shape)
```
The output of the `MaxPooling2D` layer will be a 2D tensor with a reduced spatial dimensions, but with the same number of channels.
4. **Activation Functions:**
```
import keras

# Define a 1D tensor (e.g., a scalar value)

input = keras.Input(shape=1)

# Apply a sigmoid activation function to the tensor

output = keras.layers.Dense(units=1, activation='sigmoid')(input)
print(output.shape)
```
The output of the `Dense` layer will be a 1D tensor with the same shape as the input tensor, but with the sigmoid activation function applied.
5. **Optimization Algorithms:**
```
import keras

# Define a 1D tensor (e.g., a scalar value)

input = keras.Input(shape=1)

# Define an ANN with a single layer

output = keras.layers.Dense(units=1, activation='sigmoid')(input)

# Define the loss function and the optimization algorithm

loss = keras.losses.MSE()

optimizer = keras.optimizers.SGD(learning_rate=0.01)

# Compile the model

model = keras.Model(inputs=input, outputs=output)

model.compile(loss=loss, optimizer=optimizer)

# Train the model

model.fit(x=input, epochs=100)
```
In this example, we define an ANN with a single layer, and then use the `SGD` optimization algorithm to minimize the mean squared error (MSE) between the predicted output and the actual output.
