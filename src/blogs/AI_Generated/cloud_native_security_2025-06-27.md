# Cloud Native Security: A New Frontier in Application Security

Cloud native applications are becoming increasingly popular, as they offer greater scalability and flexibility than traditional on-premises applications. However, this new frontier in application development also presents new security challenges. In this blog post, we'll explore the unique security considerations of cloud native applications and how to address them.
### Challenges of Cloud Native Security

1. **Ephemeral infrastructure:** Cloud native applications are built to take advantage of cloud-based infrastructure, which can be ephemeral in nature. This means that security controls must be designed to handle dynamic infrastructure and automatically adapt to changing conditions.
2. **Containerization and orchestration:** Cloud native applications often use containerization and orchestration tools like Docker and Kubernetes. While these tools offer many benefits, they also introduce new security risks, such as the potential for container escape attacks.
3. **Serverless functions:** With the rise of serverless computing, some cloud native applications are moving towards function-based architectures. This introduces new security challenges, such as the need to secure code execution and data storage in a distributed environment.
4. **Multi-cloud environments:** Many organizations are adopting a multi-cloud strategy, which can lead to security challenges as data and applications are distributed across multiple cloud providers.
### Addressing Cloud Native Security Challenges

To address the unique security challenges of cloud native applications, we need to take a different approach to security. Here are some strategies that can help:
### 1. **Use secure coding practices:** One of the most important steps in cloud native security is to ensure that applications are built with security in mind. This means using secure coding practices, such as input validation and secure data storage.
### 2. **Implement security controls for ephemeral infrastructure:** As cloud native infrastructure is ephemeral in nature, security controls must be designed to handle dynamic infrastructure and automatically adapt to changing conditions. This can be achieved through the use of automation and machine learning.
### 3. **Use container security solutions:** To address the security risks associated with containerization and orchestration, we need to use container security solutions, such as container firewalls and security probes.
### 4. **Secure serverless functions:** To secure serverless functions, we need to implement security controls at the function level, such as function authorization and encryption.
### 5. **Manage multi-cloud security:** To manage security across multiple cloud providers, we need to use a unified security approach that can handle data and application security across different environments.
### 6. **Use automation and machine learning:** Automation and machine learning can help us to automate security controls and detect security threats in real-time. This can help us to respond to security incidents more quickly and effectively.
### 7. **Monitor and analyze security data:** To detect and respond to security threats in a cloud native environment, we need to monitor and analyze security data in real-time. This can help us to identify security incidents and take action to prevent them.
### 8. **Use security frameworks and standards:** To ensure that cloud native security is properly aligned with industry best practices, we need to use security frameworks and standards, such as the Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).
Conclusion
Cloud native security presents unique challenges, but with the right strategies and tools, we can overcome these challenges and ensure the security of cloud native applications. By using secure coding practices, implementing security controls for ephemeral infrastructure, using container security solutions, securing serverless functions, managing multi-cloud security, using automation and machine learning, monitoring and analyzing security data, and using security frameworks and standards, we can build secure and reliable cloud native applications.
