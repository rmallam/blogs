Cloud Native Security
================

As more and more organizations adopt cloud native applications, the importance of cloud native security cannot be overstated. Cloud native applications are designed to take advantage of cloud computing's scalability, flexibility, and reliability, but this also presents new security challenges. In this blog post, we'll explore the unique security challenges of cloud native applications and discuss how to address them using cloud native security techniques.
Security Challenges of Cloud Native Applications
----------------------------------------

### 1. Ephemeral Infrastructure

Cloud native applications are designed to be highly scalable and flexible, which means that infrastructure is often ephemeral and can change rapidly. This makes it difficult to maintain consistent security policies and configurations across different environments.

### 2. Hybrid Environments

Cloud native applications often involve a mix of on-premises and cloud-based resources, which can create security challenges when it comes to managing access controls and consistency.

### 3. Complexity

Cloud native applications are often built using a complex mix of technologies, which can create security challenges when it comes to identifying and addressing vulnerabilities.

### 4. Shadow IT

Cloud native applications often involve shadow IT, where developers are using cloud services and tools without proper approval or oversight. This can create security challenges when it comes to ensuring compliance and security.

### 5. Lack of Visibility

It can be difficult to get visibility into cloud native applications and their security posture, which can make it difficult to identify and address security vulnerabilities.

### 6. Lack of Skills

Cloud native security requires specialized skills and knowledge, which can be difficult to find and retain.

### 7. Lack of Standards

There are no standard security practices for cloud native applications, which can make it difficult to ensure consistency and compliance.

Cloud Native Security Techniques
---------------------------

To address the security challenges of cloud native applications, we need to use cloud native security techniques. These techniques are designed to take advantage of the scalability, flexibility, and reliability of cloud computing, while also providing consistent security policies and configurations across different environments.

### 1. Service Meshes

Service meshes are a cloud native security technique that provides a centralized, configurable, and highly available infrastructure layer for service-to-service communication. This can help to improve security by providing a consistent security policy across all services.

### 2. Network Functions

Network functions are a cloud native security technique that provides a suite of network functions, such as firewalls, load balancers, and VPNs, that are designed to be highly scalable and flexible. These functions can be used to improve security by providing a consistent security policy across all services.

### 3. Istio

Istio is a cloud native security technique that provides a platform for building and managing service meshes. It provides a consistent security policy across all services, while also providing visibility and control over service-to-service communication.

### 4. Kubernetes

Kubernetes is a cloud native security technique that provides a platform for deploying and managing containerized applications. It provides a consistent security policy across all containers, while also providing visibility and control over containerized applications.

### 5. Cloud Security Platforms

Cloud security platforms are a cloud native security technique that provides a centralized, scalable, and highly available security platform for cloud native applications. These platforms provide a consistent security policy across all applications, while also providing visibility and control over application security.

### 6. Security Orchestration

Security orchestration is a cloud native security technique that provides a centralized, scalable, and highly available security platform for cloud native applications. It provides a consistent security policy across all applications, while also providing visibility and control over application security.

### 7. Cloud Native Security Tools

Cloud native security tools are a cloud native security technique that provides a centralized, scalable, and highly available security platform for cloud native applications. These tools provide a consistent security policy across all applications, while also providing visibility and control over application security.

Conclusion

Cloud native security is a critical aspect of cloud computing, as it provides a consistent security policy across all applications, while also providing visibility and control over application security. By using cloud native security techniques, such as service meshes, network functions, Istio, Kubernetes, cloud security platforms, security orchestration, and cloud native security tools, we can ensure that our cloud native applications are secure and compliant with industry standards.
