# Deep Learning Explained

Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning (ML) that uses neural networks with many layers to analyze and interpret complex data. It is      particularly effective in tasks such as image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and autonomous driving. Deep Learning models can learn from vast amounts of data, making them highly accurate and capable of solving complex problems.
