### Introduction

OpenShift is a powerful platform for deploying and managing applications in a Kubernetes environment. In this blog post, we will explore how to use OpenShift to deploy and manage a simple web application.
### Prerequisites

Before we begin, you will need to have an OpenShift cluster set up and running. You can create a cluster using the OpenShift Origin software, which is available for free and open source. Alternatively, you can use a cloud provider such as Red Hat OpenShift Online or IBM Cloud.
Once you have your OpenShift cluster set up, you will need to install the `oc` command-line tool. This tool is used to interact with the OpenShift cluster and perform operations such as deploying applications.
To install the `oc` tool, run the following command:
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y oc
```
### Deploying an Application

Now that we have the `oc` tool installed, let's deploy a simple web application. We will create a new directory called `web-app` and add the following code to it:
```
# web-app/index.html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>My Web Application</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Welcome to my web application!</h1>
  <p>This is a simple web application.</p>
</body>
```
Next, we will create a ` deployment.yaml` file in the `web-app` directory to define the deployment of the application. This file should include the following:
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-web-app
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-web-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-web-app
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: my-web-app
        image: web-app
        ports:
         - containerPort: 80
```
This `deployment.yaml` file defines a deployment with a single replica, and specifies that the deployment should use a label selector to match the `app: my-web-app` label. It also includes a container named `my-web-app` that uses the `web-app` image.
Next, we will create a `service.yaml` file in the `web-app` directory to define the service that will expose the application. This file should include the following:
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-web-app-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: my-web-app
  ports:
   - name: http
     port: 80
```
This `service.yaml` file defines a service named `my-web-app-service` that selects the `my-web-app` deployment using a label selector, and exposes the application on port 80 using the `http` port.
With our `deployment.yaml` and `service.yaml` files created, we can now use the `oc` tool to deploy the application. We will run the following command:
```
oc apply -f deployment.yaml
```
This command will apply the `deployment.yaml` file to the OpenShift cluster, creating the deployment.
Next, we will create a `route.yaml` file in the `web-app` directory to define a route that will expose the application. This file should include the following:
```
apiVersion: v1
kind: Route
metadata:
  name: my-web-app-route
spec:
  host: my-web-app.openshift.io
  route:
    - from:
        host: my-web-app.openshift.io
        path: /
        port: 80
```
This `route.yaml` file defines a route named `my-web-app-route` that maps the host `my-web-app.openshift.io` to the `my-web-app` service on port 80.
Finally, we will run the following command to apply the `route.yaml` file:
```
oc apply -f route.yaml
```
This command will apply the `route.yaml` file to the OpenShift cluster, creating the route.
With our application deployed, we can now access it by visiting `http://my-web-app.openshift.io` in our web browser.
### Conclusion

In this blog post, we have demonstrated how to use OpenShift to deploy and manage a simple web application. We have covered the basic concepts of OpenShift, including deployments, services, and routes, and have shown how to use the `oc` tool to interact with the OpenShift cluster.
OpenShift is a powerful platform for deploying and managing applications in a Kubernetes environment. With its easy-to-use command-line tool and robust set of features, it is an ideal choice for deploying and managing applications in a cloud or on-premises environment. [end of text]
