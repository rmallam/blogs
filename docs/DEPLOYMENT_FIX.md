# GitHub Pages Deployment Fix

## Issue
Newly AI-generated blogs were present in the repository but not appearing on the deployed GitHub Pages website.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Blog Loading**: The Vue.js application properly loads all AI-generated blogs in development using `require.context('./blogs', true, /\.md$/)`
2. **Build Process**: The production build correctly includes all blog files in the JavaScript bundle
3. **Deployment Issue**: The GitHub Pages deployment workflow had several issues:
   - Missing `GITHUB_REPOSITORY` environment variable during build
   - Missing proper permissions for GitHub Pages
   - Potential issue with workflow triggering from automated commits

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Enhanced Deployment Workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`)
- Added `GITHUB_REPOSITORY` environment variable to ensure correct publicPath configuration
- Added proper GitHub Pages permissions
- Ensured consistent build environment

### 2. Improved Daily Blog Generation (`.github/workflows/daily-blog.yml`)
- Updated commit author to use proper GitHub Actions bot identity
- Added explicit deployment workflow trigger
- Improved error handling in git operations

### 3. Configuration Verification
- Verified `vue.config.js` correctly sets publicPath for GitHub Pages (`/blogs/`)
- Confirmed webpack properly includes markdown files as assets
- Validated build output has correct resource paths

## Testing
1. **Development**: All AI-generated blogs load correctly in `npm run serve`
2. **Production Build**: `npm run build` generates correct assets with `/blogs/` prefix
3. **Blog Detection**: Over 100 AI-generated blog files are properly detected and bundled

## Expected Result
After these fixes are merged to the main branch:
1. The deployment workflow will properly trigger on AI blog generation
2. The built site will have correct asset paths for GitHub Pages
3. All AI-generated blogs will be visible on the live website at `https://rmallam.github.io/blogs/`

## Monitoring
To verify the fix is working:
1. Check GitHub Actions runs after merge
2. Verify new AI-generated blogs appear on the live site
3. Monitor deployment workflow success/failure
